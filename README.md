# ARCore Experiments by Pancodemakes
Code written to play around with ARCore. This code uses lockscreen and profile picture artwork that I have recently made for myself and as examples of what may be used in a commission. 
More code to follow soon, as this is a very early WIP. The code is open source, but the artwork is NOT open source.
